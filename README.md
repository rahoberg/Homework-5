Problem1:
The first three have rational reconstructions -20/13, 17, 81/19.
The fourth does not have a rational reconstruction with the given bounds.

Problem 2:
2^(n-1) is not congruent to 1 mod n, and therefore by Fermat's little theorem it is composite.
n=68222080226222296181917368518534332259513625527062166102114730123514248558349*
